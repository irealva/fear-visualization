NYT API Articles
================

This app displays the occurrences of the term "Venezuela" in the New York Times headlines from 1954-2014 and displays article details for each year. 

I downloaded the data (/static/data/articlesByYear.csv) from the New York Times API, used [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) to graph the data, and D3 to create a table with article details. 

I've uploaded the project to the Google Cloud Platform: http://nyt-api-articles.appspot.com/
