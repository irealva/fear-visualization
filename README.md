NYT API Articles
================

This app loads a csv file containing information about the occurrences of the term "venezuela" in the New York Times headlines and displays it as a chart. 

I downloaded the data from the New York Times API, used [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) to graph the data, and D3 to create a table with article details. 

I've uploaded the project to the Google Cloud Platform: http://nyt-api-articles.appspot.com/
